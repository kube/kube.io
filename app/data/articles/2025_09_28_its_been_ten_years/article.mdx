description: A quick intro to my blog.

I discovered programming at nine with Visual Basic. The internet was then booming, and I built my first web pages in FrontPage, later with Dreamweaver with PHP/MySQL, and explored design with Photoshop, Flash, and Fireworks. In high school I drifted toward design—programming wasn’t cool—until the iPhone made tech exciting again.

The web evolved fast: Flash faded, HTML5 rose, web apps became powerful, no more Encarta and Universalis, Wikipedia was the go-to encyclopedia. Google Docs replaced Microsoft Word. StackOverflow helped programmers learn and debug. Any answer was a Google search away. The Web Browser replaced the Desktop: everything was in the cloud.

In 2012 I doubled down on JavaScript, along with Node.js and TypeScript, and by 2015 I was freelancing, progressively specializing in frontend and UI.
Mobile apps influenced how we build UI.
JavaScript and Web Technologies were everywhere: from web to mobile and desktop.

Then AI crept in, and leapt. Predictive systems reshaped marketing and advertising. Copilot changed how developers write code; ChatGPT changed everything—less web browsing, more conversations with an assistant that helps with emails, essays, code, and even recipes.
And more recently MCP allowed LLMs to interface with anything.

AI changed what we build and how we build it—for users and developers. Line‑by‑line completion already feels boomer; now everyone talks about Windsurf, Cursor, and vibe‑coding—prompting, iterating, and validating instead of hand‑coding everything.

It’s wild how much can shift in a decade. Maybe the web gives way to AI interfaces; either way, it’s another era of tech, and ten years from now will be unrecognizable again.

This blog won't be focused on AI, I just want to start this post by sharing my thoughts at the moment I write this first post, as a reference point for the future.

Still, AI will certainly shape what I build and how I build it.
