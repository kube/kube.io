description: A quick intro to my blog.

I discovered programming at nine with [Visual Basic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)>). The internet was booming, and I built my first web pages in [FrontPage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage), later [Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver) with PHP/MySQL, and explored design in Photoshop, [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), and [Fireworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Fireworks). In high school I drifted toward design—programming wasn’t cool—until the iPhone made tech exciting again.

The web evolved fast: Flash faded, HTML5 rose, and web apps became powerful. [Encarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta) gave way to Wikipedia. Google Docs displaced Microsoft Word. Stack Overflow became the go‑to Q&A for developers. Any answer was a Google search away. The Web Browser replaced the Desktop: everything was in the cloud.

In 2012 I doubled down on JavaScript and web technologies, and by 2015 I was freelancing, progressively specializing in frontend and UI.
Mobile apps influenced how we build UI.
JavaScript and Web Technologies were everywhere: from web to mobile and desktop.

Then AI crept in, and leapt. Predictive systems reshaped marketing and advertising. Copilot changed how developers write; ChatGPT turned browsing into conversation: A tailored answer is a prompt away.
And more recently [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) allowed LLMs to interface with anything.

AI changed what we build and how we build it—for users and developers. Line‑by‑line completion already feels boomer; now everyone talks about Windsurf, Cursor, and vibe‑coding—prompting, iterating, and validating instead of hand‑coding everything.

It’s wild how much can shift in a decade. Maybe the web gives way to AI interfaces; either way, we're entering another era, and ten years from now will be unrecognizable again.

This blog won't be focused on AI, I just want to start this post by capturing my thoughts at the moment I write this first post, as a reference point for the future.

Still, AI will shape what I build and how I build it.
