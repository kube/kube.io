description: A quick intro to my blog.

I discovered programming at nine while the internet was booming. I built pages in FrontPage and Dreamweaver with PHP/MySQL, and explored design with Photoshop, Flash, and Fireworks. In high school I drifted toward design—programming wasn’t cool—until the iPhone made tech exciting again.

The web evolved fast: Flash faded, HTML5 rose, web apps became powerful, and StackOverflow became the classroom. In 2012 I doubled down on JavaScript across web, mobile, and desktop, found Node.js and TypeScript, and by 2015 I was freelancing, specializing in frontend architecture and UI.

AI crept in, then leapt. Predictive systems reshaped marketing and advertising. Copilot changed how we write code; ChatGPT changed everything—less web browsing, more conversations with an assistant that helps with emails, essays, code, and even recipes.

Quickly, AI changed what we build and how we build it—for users and developers. Line‑by‑line completion already feels boomer; now everyone talks about Windsurf, Cursor, and vibe‑coding—prompting, iterating, and validating instead of hand‑coding everything.

It’s wild how much can shift in a decade. Maybe the web gives way to AI interfaces; either way, it’s another era of tech, and ten years from now will be unrecognizable again.

This blog won't be focused on AI, I just want to start this post by sharing my thoughts at the moment I write this first post, as a reference point for the future.

Still, AI will certainly shape what I build and how I build it.
