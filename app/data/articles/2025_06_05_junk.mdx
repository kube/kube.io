# Hello

This is the problem

I recently decided to use recent CSS features in my website, like Scroll-Timeline animations, and View Transitions.

CSS is always a domain in which I feel that I don't have the basics.

It is an awesome tool, which seems to be very powerful, but I never took the time to learn it properly.

It is also a domain in which there is a lot of abstraction, and almost nobody use the system as it is intended to be used.

For instance, most people (including me), use an higher-level framework like Tailwind, or CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components, or Emotion.

For animations, I was previously using `motion` (previously `framer-motion`) to animate the header on scroll, and for page transitions on page titles.

Motion is a really powerful library, but like all JavaScript ...


## Second-level heading

```ts
const x = 42 + 1337;
```

```ts hello
const x = 42 + 1337;
console.log(x);
```
```ts world
const x = 42 + 1337;
console.log(x);
```

```mermaid
graph LR
  A -. hello .-> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
```

## Second Example

### TFM API

```mermaid
graph BT
  classDef database fill:#d99e1e,color:black;

  subgraph TFM API
    Database[(Database)]:::database
    Resolver((Resolver))

    Resolver --> Database
  end

  subgraph PollyJS Mocks
    MA(("{A}"))
    MB(("{B}"))
    MC(("{C}"))
    MD(("{D}"))
    ME(("{E}"))
  end

  subgraph Requests
    A((A))
    B((B))
    C((C))
    D((D))
    E((E))
  end

  A --> MA --> Resolver
  B --> MB --> Resolver
  C --> MC --> Resolver
  D --> MD --> Resolver
  E --> ME --> Resolver
```

## Third Example

```mermaid
graph LR
  classDef database fill:#d99e1e,color:black;
  classDef frontend fill:#6F549A,color:white;
  classDef api fill:#CA2A8A,color:white;

  Frontend([Frontend]):::frontend
    --> Internet
    --> VPN
    --> API((API)):::api
    --> DB[(Database)]:::database
```

## Fourth Example

```mermaid
graph BT
  VirtualServer
  VirtualCLI -.Instantiates.-> VirtualServer
  VirtualCLI -.Exposes.-> VirtualDashboard
  VirtualDashboard --> VirtualServer
```
