Hello, and welcome to my new blog! For those of you who don’t know me, I’ve spent the last 12 years in the software development industry, specializing in TypeScript and Node.js since their early days. I’ve had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the evolution of web technologies, frameworks, and practices that have shaped how we build software today. Over the years, my passion for these technologies has only grown, and I’m excited to share that passion with you through this blog.

Starting a blog is a new adventure for me, a place to document not just the _how_ but the _why_ behind many of the choices we make as developers. While the technology landscape shifts at a rapid pace, I find myself constantly thinking about what makes good software and how we can craft solutions that are not only functional but maintainable and scalable in the long term. This blog will be my way of exploring those thoughts and sharing my findings with you.

I plan to delve into new projects, ideas, and perhaps some experimental builds here. Along the way, I'll be covering the latest updates in TypeScript, Node.js, and the broader JavaScript ecosystem, along with anything new that catches my interest. I believe in keeping an open mind in this industry, as you never know what new technology or tool will change the game next. Through these posts, I hope to keep both you and myself at the cutting edge of software development.

Beyond technical content, I’ll also be sharing my perspectives on the methods and principles that underpin good software design. Software is more than code; it's about problem-solving, understanding users, and making design choices that stand the test of time. I look forward to unpacking these topics, reflecting on experiences, and, hopefully, sparking some great conversations along the way.

So, thank you for stopping by and reading this first post. Whether you’re a fellow developer, a tech enthusiast, or just curious, I’m glad to have you here. I hope this blog becomes a valuable resource and a place for dialogue about where software is heading and how we, as developers, can be a part of shaping that future. Stay tuned!
