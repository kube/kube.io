          |**Monolite** is a simple, type-safe,
          |[Structural-Sharing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLvrZPSzHxo&feature=youtu.be&t=1390)
          |library.
          |
          |It was originally written for usage in Redux reducers,
          |but can be used anywhere you want to preserve an object immutability.
          |
          |**ImmutableJS** is
          |[not able to infer type](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/issues/1462)
          |on sub-state-trees as it uses strings to define sub-tree to update:
          |
          |\`\`\`js
          |state.set(['some', 'nested', 'property'], 42)
          |\`\`\`
          |
          |Monolite, on its side, uses accessor functions to get the target node
          |of the state tree to update:
          |\`\`\`js
          |set(state, _ => _.some.nested.property, 42)
          |\`\`\`
          |
          |This allows TypeScript to do static analysis and
          |completion on the sub-state type, and type of the updated value.
          |
          |The library uses ES6 Proxies under-the-hood to analyze the
          |accessor function.
          |These functions, though, can be statically resolved, using
          |[a Babel Plugin](https://github.com/kube/babel-plugin-monolite),
          |permitting to target older browsers not supporting \`Proxy\`.

		title: 'ReturnOf',
		text: paddedText`
          |**ReturnOf** was a workaround solution permitting type inference
          |on function returns in TypeScript.
          |
          |Getting the return type of a function is something particularly
          |interesting, in case of Redux Action Creators or React-Redux
          |containers, to prevent code duplication, for example.
          |
          |I had also opened a proposal on TypeScript
          |[static type inference](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14400),
          |enabling a static-only solution for return type inference.
          |
          |TypeScript 2.8 finally introduced
          |[Conditional Types](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/21316),
          |and added a new [\`ReturnType\`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/21496)

		title: 'WhenSwitch',
		text: paddedText`
          |**WhenSwitch** adds Ruby-like \`case/when\` statements in JavaScript,
          |through a single \`when\` function.
          |
          |Ternary expressions become too much nested when handling too much cases,
          |and switch statements are
          |[error-prone and block-only](https://medium.com/chrisburgin/rewriting-javascript-replacing-the-switch-statement-cfff707cf045),
          |WhenSwitch enables simple function conditional flows, as expressions:
          |
          |\`\`\`js
          |const getDrinkPrice = drink =>
          |  when(drink)
          |    .is('Coke', 1.50)
          |    .is('Pepsi', 1.80)
          |    .else(2.00)
          |\`\`\`
          |
          |This is useful for conditional components in React for example:
          |\`\`\`jsx
          |<div>
          |  {
          |    when(props.page)
          |      .is('Hello', () => <HelloPage />)
          |      .is('World', () => <WorldPage />)
          |      .else(() => <Page404 />)
          |  }
          |</div>
          |\`\`\`
          |
          |JavaScript not being lazily evaluated though,
          |it adds some overhead on expressions, needing to wrap them in thunks.
          |
          |Another issue is with TypeScript: The goal here was to have something
          |completely type-safe, but as it was impossible at the moment to define
          |generic [type guards](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/types/typeGuard.html),
          |I left this library as it was, and for now only use it for simple cases.
