This **Sudoku** was my first C project, when at **Faculty of Science of Luminy**.

The subject was to create a **Sudoku Solver**, with a simple graphical interface, using a simple Fa√ßade library for LibX/Win32 named [EZ-Draw](https://pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~edouard.thiel/ez-draw/index.html).

Skeleton of the project was given with most of code structure, with program state already defined, the goal was to add a simple **back-tracking algorithm** to check if the user-given grid was valid and solve it if possible.

My project added a grid generator, with multiple available levels, and some work has been done on the UI to have something responsive and clean.
