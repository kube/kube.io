42 first project.

**LibFt** is a recode of a subset of the [C Standard Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library), which is the first building block of all other C projects at 42.

Usage of **LibC is prohibited** in 42 C Projects, so each project needs to use only functions from our own LibFt.

With the time, multiple functions were added, to include Color Manipulation, Data-Structures, Trigonometry, Infinite Numbers, Hash Function, and a basic Test Framework.
