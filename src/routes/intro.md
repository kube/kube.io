I'm an alumni from [42](http://www.42.fr/), a pretty cool computer science school in Paris, France.

During the last four years, I've been working a lot with web technologies, mostly from the JavaScript ecosystem. This brought me to work on JavaScript Piscine for 42, an intensive pedagogical two-week course.

Architecture matters to me. Things have to stay clean and simple, and with this in mind I take time creating modules and boilerplates, trying to bring some purity in my work.

Currently, I'm going back to the roots, exploring Compiler Design and Functional Programming.

Graphic Design is also something I care about. I've been working by the past on multiple graphic design projects, like logo, serigraphy or webdesign.
